# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Today is the first of February 2026, and I am 19.

I'm writing this while on my weekend off from work at Multicom Resources in Julia Creek, QLD.

I aspire to be an ASIC engineer at Nvidia when I graduate. 

I'm starting by using Github to document my journey.
